# SystemCalls
In this lab we were asked to implement three C programs which emphasise the main system call functions.

The first program, “ mycat.c ” , shows the content of a specified file (passed as an argument) in the console (through standard output) using the function write().
The second program, “ myls.c “ , opens a directory (either one specified or the current one) and prints on the screen all the entries that this directory contains.
The third program, “ mysize.c “, obtains the current directory and prints a list of every file contained as well as its size in bytes.
